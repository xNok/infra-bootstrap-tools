# Repository Analysis Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the initial PARA knowledge organization scan of the infra-bootstrap-tools repository, conducted January 25, 2025.

## What Was Analyzed

- 50+ markdown files across the repository
- Project documentation in agentic/, ansible/, stacks/, bin/
- Website content and tutorials
- Configuration files and READMEs

## Identified Components

### Projects (7)
Active and planned initiatives with specific goals and timelines.

### Areas (4)
Ongoing areas of responsibility requiring continuous attention.

### Resources (3 core + many identified)
Tools and technologies used across projects. Initial resource documents created for:
- Caddy (reverse proxy)
- Portainer (container management)
- Nix (reproducible environments)

**Additional resources identified for future documentation:**
n8n, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Prefect, MCP, OpenZiti, SPIRE, Keycloak, Hugo, pre-commit, Changesets, and others.

## Cross-References

All documents include structured frontmatter with:
- Type classification (project/area/resource)
- Status indicators (active/planning/investigating)
- Related projects, areas, and resources
- Descriptions and context

## Next Steps

1. Continue creating resource documents for identified tools
2. Archive completed projects to `4-archives/`
3. Refine and migrate polished content to `website/docs`
4. Maintain cross-references as projects evolve
