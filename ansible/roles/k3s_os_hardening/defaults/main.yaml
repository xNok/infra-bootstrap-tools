# Defaults for OS Hardening
k3s_os_hardening_default_input: "deny"
k3s_os_hardening_default_output: "allow"
# CRITICAL SECURITY SETTING: This CIDR controls which IPs can access K3s internal ports.
# The default is intentionally restrictive (small /24 subnet) to fail safely.
# You MUST override this with your actual internal network CIDR range.
# Examples based on your infrastructure:
# - 10.0.0.0/24 or 10.1.0.0/16 for small to medium networks
# - 192.168.1.0/24 for home/small office networks
# - For production: use the smallest CIDR that includes all your K3s nodes
k3s_os_hardening_k3s_api_cidr: "10.0.0.0/24"  # Internal network CIDR for K3s traffic - OVERRIDE THIS
