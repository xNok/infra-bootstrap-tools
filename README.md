This repository provides Ansible playbooks to set up a minimal infrastructure for a simple self-hosted application. Ideal for small hobby projects. I made this repository a place to **Learn** about DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure. You have all the tutorial you need to get started.

Features:
* docker-swarm
* Caddy
* Portainer

## Development Environment Setup

This project provides a script to help you set up your local development environment. Additionally, a Gitpod configuration is available for a cloud-based, ready-to-use environment.

### Local Setup Script

The `./bin/bash/setup.sh` script can install the following tools:

*   **pre-commit**: For running linters and formatters automatically before committing code.
*   **Ansible**: For infrastructure automation.
*   **1Password CLI**: For managing secrets.
*   **Boilerplate**: For generating boilerplate code.
*   **Hugo**: For building and serving the documentation website.

To use the script, run it with the names of the tools you want to install. For example, to install pre-commit and Ansible:

```bash
./bin/bash/setup.sh pre-commit ansible
```

### Gitpod

Alternatively, you can use Gitpod to get a pre-configured development environment in your browser. Click the button below to get started:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Got your [prerequisites](./website/content/en/docs/gs1.getting_started.md#prerequisites) and [secrets configured](./website/content/en/docs/gs1.getting_started.md#configuration-secrets-management)?

Deploy your entire infrastructure with a single command:

```bash
make up
```

This command will:
*   Provision infrastructure on DigitalOcean using Terraform.
*   Install Docker on all hosts.
*   Initialize a Docker Swarm cluster.
*   Deploy Caddy and Portainer applications.

To tear down the infrastructure:

```bash
make down
```

For a detailed step-by-step guide, including prerequisites and secret management options, please refer to our **[Full Getting Started Guide](./website/content/en/docs/gs1.getting_started.md)**.

## Articles and Tutorials

The articles/tutorials are divided into sections. 
* **Introduction** -> What are the tools to manage infrastructure? Perfect to learn the basis.
* **How-tos** -> Good takeaway from this project - Answers many questions you could encounter in the future
* **Deepening Understanding** -> Learn more about each application used in this setup (Portainer, Graphana, Caddy, etc.)
* **Local Experimentation & Advanced Topics**: Deeper dives into specific setups and components.

I used [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.pxf.io/q4b2qO) for experiments because it is cheap, but any cloud provider should work, as we are mainly playing with Virtual Machines. You can even get [$200 DigitalOcean free credit](https://digitalocean.pxf.io/q4b2qO) when starting

## Handy toolchain

Do you want to go fast? Too lazy to set up your local environment?

Then, use the tools from a Docker container. I included a simple Toochain in this repository and a useful alias for it.

Use common infrastructure tools in docker with:
* [docker_tools_alias.sh](bin/bash/docker_tools_alias.sh)

```
source ./bin/docker_tools_alias.sh
```

```
use dasb for ansible in docker
use dap for ansible-playbook in docker
use daws for awscli in docker
use dpk for packer in docker
use dtf for terraform in docker
use dbash for bash in docker
```

## Tools Showcase

This project leverages several tools to streamline development and improve code quality. Here's a brief overview of some of them:

*   **Pre-commit**: We use pre-commit hooks to automate linting, formatting, and other checks before code is committed. This helps maintain code consistency and catch errors early. Configuration can be found in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
*   **1Password CLI**: For securely managing sensitive information like API keys and passwords, the 1Password CLI can be integrated into your workflow. The setup script provides an option to install it.
*   **Boilerplate**: [Gruntwork Boilerplate](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/boilerplate) is used to generate répétitive code structures, ensuring consistency and saving time. You can find boilerplate templates in the `.boilerplates` directory.
*   **Hugo**: The project documentation website (what you're likely reading if you're on the website!) is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. The website content is in the `website/` directory.

## Scale Up

With docker swarm and portainer it because easy to manager multiple nodes.
