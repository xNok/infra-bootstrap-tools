# Getting Started with Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice that enables developers and operations teams to manage and provision infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than manual configuration.

## Why IaC?

- **Consistency**: Ensure your infrastructure is deployed the same way every time
- **Version Control**: Track changes to your infrastructure over time
- **Automation**: Reduce manual work and human error
- **Scalability**: Easily replicate infrastructure across environments

## Popular IaC Tools

- **Ansible**: Configuration management and orchestration
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure provisioning across multiple cloud providers
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent application deployment

## Getting Started
