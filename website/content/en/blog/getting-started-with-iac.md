# What is Terraform Cloud and Why You Might Need It

Terraform Cloud is HashiCorp's managed service that enhances Terraform's infrastructure-as-code capabilities with collaboration features, remote state management, and policy enforcement.

## Key Features

**Remote State Management**: Terraform Cloud securely stores your infrastructure state in the cloud, eliminating the need for manual state file management and preventing conflicts in team environments.

**Collaboration & Governance**: Teams can work together with features like workspace management, role-based access control, and policy as code using Sentinel.

**Private Module Registry**: Share and version Terraform modules privately within your organization for consistent infrastructure patterns.

**Cost Estimation**: Preview infrastructure costs before applying changes, helping teams make informed decisions about resource provisioning.

## Why Consider Terraform Cloud?

- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple team members can safely work on infrastructure without state conflicts
- **Security**: Centralized credential management and audit logging
- **Workflow Integration**: Connect with VCS providers like GitHub for automated runs
- **Free Tier Available**: Small teams can start without cost

## Getting Started
