This document provides an overview of core Ansible concepts and how they are utilized in the `infra-bootstrap-tools` project. Understanding these will help you navigate and customize the automation scripts.

## 1. Playbooks

*   **What they are:** Ansible Playbooks are YAML files that define a set of tasks to be executed on managed nodes (servers). They are the core of Ansible's configuration management and orchestration capabilities.
*   **In this project:**
    *   The main playbook is `ansible/playbooks/main.yml`. This orchestrates the entire infrastructure setup, from provisioning with Terraform to deploying applications like Caddy and Portainer.
    *   Other playbooks like `ansible/playbooks/terraform.yml` might handle specific, smaller parts of the process.

## 2. Tasks

*   **What they are:** Tasks are the individual units of action in Ansible. Each task calls an Ansible module (e.g., `apt` for package management, `copy` for file transfer, `shell` for running commands) to perform a specific operation.
*   **In this project:** Tasks are defined within roles (see below) and playbooks. For example, a task in the `docker` role might install the Docker engine, while a task in the `docker_swarm_app_caddy` role would deploy the Caddy service to the swarm.

## 3. Roles

*   **What they are:** Roles are Ansible's way of organizing automation content into self-contained, reusable units. They typically encapsulate tasks, handlers, variables, templates, and files needed to configure a specific piece of software or a system aspect.
*   **In this project:** Roles are heavily used to structure the automation. You can find them in `ansible/roles/`. Examples include:
    *   `terraform_digitalocean`: Manages the creation and destruction of infrastructure on DigitalOcean.
    *   `docker`: Installs and configures Docker on hosts.
    *   `docker_swarm_manager`: Initializes the Docker Swarm and manages manager nodes.
    *   `docker_swarm_app_caddy`: Deploys Caddy as a Docker Swarm service.
    *   Using roles makes the main playbook (`ansible/playbooks/main.yml`) cleaner and easier to understand.

## 4. Inventory

*   **What it is:** An inventory file defines the hosts (servers) that Ansible will manage. It can be static (a simple text file) or dynamic (generated by scripts, e.g., from cloud provider APIs). Inventories can also group hosts.
*   **In this project:**
    *   The primary static inventory is likely located at `ansible/playbooks/inventory/`.
    *   Terraform plays a role in dynamically populating parts of the inventory or providing the information needed to connect to the newly provisioned hosts. The `terraform_digitalocean` role, for instance, outputs information about created droplets that Ansible then uses.
    *   Host groups like `managers` and `nodes` are used in `ansible/playbooks/main.yml` to target specific plays to the correct servers.

## 5. Variables (`host_vars` and `group_vars`)

*   **What they are:** Variables are used to customize playbook execution and adapt it to different environments or hosts without changing the core logic of tasks and roles.
    *   `group_vars`: Variables defined here apply to all hosts within a specific group in the inventory.
    *   `host_vars`: Variables defined here apply to a specific host.
*   **In this project:**
    *   `ansible/playbooks/group_vars/all.yml`: Contains variables that apply to all hosts, such as the 1Password lookup for Rclone secrets.
    *   `ansible/playbooks/group_vars/managers.yaml`: Contains variables specific to the `managers` group, like Caddy configuration details retrieved from 1Password.
    *   `ansible/playbooks/host_vars/localhost.yml`: Contains variables for the `localhost` (where Ansible is run from), especially secrets for Terraform provisioning (DigitalOcean token, AWS credentials for S3 backend) fetched via 1Password.
    *   These variables are crucial for parameterizing the deployment and securely managing secrets.

Understanding these concepts will provide a solid foundation for working with the `infra-bootstrap-tools` and tailoring them to your specific needs.
